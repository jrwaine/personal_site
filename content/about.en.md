My name is **Waine Junior**, I am 20 years old, live in **Curitiba, Brazil** and currently doing computer engineering at **UTFPR**.

Currently my main interests in the computational field are **HPC (High performance computing)** and **parallel computatational architectures**. I have experience in some other fields as **digital image processing**, **databases**, **Web development**, among others.

Besides that, I like to ride a bike (when I'm not injured), read fantasy books (George R.R. Martin please finish A Song of Ice and Fire) and to listen to a lot of podcasts and music (follow me at [LastFM](https://www.last.fm/user/jr_waine)).

## Skills

The main programming languages and APIs that I use are:

* **C/C++**
* **Python**
* **OpenCL** e **CUDA**

I have also worked with other languages and frameworks as **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React** and **PHP**.

Regarding technologies, I have experience in **SQL**, **Git**, **Linux**, **Raspberry Pi**, **Arduino**, among others.
Besides that, I have some experience in electronics and digital circuits.

## Work

I've been doing scientific research at **[CERNN](https://cernn.ct.utfpr.edu.br)** for 2 years, working with **HPC** and **parallel computing in GPU** applied to **CFD** (computational fluid dynamics) using **LBM** (lattice Boltzmann method).
During this time, it was developed the open source software [LBM Viscoplastic](https://github.com/jrwaine/LBM-CERNN), registered in [INPI](https://www.gov.br/inpi/).
Academically, the software produced an [article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341522565_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_OF_THE_LATTICE_BOLTZMANN_METHOD_IMPLEMENTATION_ON_GPU) directly, published in [CILAMCE](https://www.cilamce2019.com.br), and many others indirectly that the authors used the program for simulation.

I also have been working for a year at [Vision Viasoft](https://viasoft.com.br/vision/), with Web development and algorithms for image processing with embedded systems.
