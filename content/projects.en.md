## Twitch Plays Chess

* **Description**: Bot written in Python to play chess at [Lichess](https://lichess.org) using the [Twitch's](https://www.twitch.tv) chat, inspired by [Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon).
Currently I am configuring a cloud server to run the bot and transmit the matches to Twitch automatically.

* **Duration**: 2020 - currently

## Viscoplastic LBM

* **Description**: Open source project in C/C++ and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) to simulate with GPUs hydrodynamic phenomena, using LBM (lattice Boltzmann method).
The software was developed at [CERNN](https://cernn.ct.utfpr.edu.br) in a research project with [Petrobras](https://petrobras.com.br/), producing several congress presentations and articles in periodicals.

* **Duration**: 2018 - currently

## NASSU LBM 

* **Description**: Project for the development of a commercial software with the same goal as *Viscoplastic LBM*, but providing more options and a graphical user interface for configuration and visualization of the simulation. 
Inspired by [Sailfish](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465514001520), it is developed in Python combining [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) for rendering templates, [PyOpenCL](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/) to access GPU resources and [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) for symbolical mathematics.

* **Duration**: 2020 - currently

## Rail Maintainer NASSU

* **Description**: Vehicle prototype for the maintenance of the screws of a rail, tightening them when they are loose.
It uses sensors and motors combined with a Raspberry Pi for the vehicle control, along with an algorithm for screw detection through image processing.

* **Duration**: 2019
